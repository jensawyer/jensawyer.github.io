      "I’ve had the privilege of working with Jen Sawyer twice now. Jen’s leadership skills, intelligence, and technical expertise are all top-tier. As the Director of Data Science and Engineering, Jen effectively managed her team while implementing features with complex technical challenges, such as training AI models and then incorporating them into new services. Her incredible depth of knowledge and keen problem-solving skills are matched by her natural talent for leading and mentoring others. Jen had the respect and trust of both her teams and other engineers across the company. She’s far more adept at managing and connecting with people than she gives herself credit for, and her team members appreciate her thoughtful guidance and support.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Jen is someone I deeply respect, both as an engineer, a leader, and a person. I would gladly work with her a third time without hesitation and wholeheartedly recommend her to any organization looking for a brilliant and compassionate engineering leader.",

      "I've known Jen since 2009 when we were both part of the first cohort in our computer science department's NLP lab during graduate school. What impressed me immediately was how she leveraged her linguistics background and engineering experience to tackle computer science challenges. Making such a transition isn't easy, but her unique combination of linguistic expertise and technical skills proved invaluable to our NLP research.\n" +
        "\n\n" +
        "Jen consistently tackles complex subjects with determination, integrity, and intellectual curiosity. Her deep understanding of language structures, combined with her growing computational expertise, brought crucial insights to our work. During our collaborations, she challenged assumptions, refined methodologies, and encouraged insightful discussions that pushed our research further. She approached problems with both linguistic precision and engineering practicality.\n" +
        "\n\n" +
        "Her resilience is one of her defining qualities. Balancing a PhD with the demands of learning computer science fundamentals and life's challenges is no small feat, yet she handled everything with remarkable discipline and grace. She doesn't just work hard—she finds solutions. Whether facing academic or life challenges, she pushes forward with determination.\n" +
        "\n\n" +
        "At Yummly, where our paths crossed again, I witnessed how her unique combination of skills created an exceptional leader. Her linguistics background gave her deep insight into language challenges, while her engineering experience and AI/ML expertise allowed her to understand technical implementation details. This comprehensive understanding meant she could intelligently guide projects at every stage - from theoretical conception to practical deployment. She didn't just lead teams; she could provide nuanced recommendations across linguistic, technical, and strategic domains.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "What made her particularly effective in management was her ability to see the full picture. Having personally navigated the complexities of language analysis, engineering implementation, and machine learning applications, she could anticipate challenges and guide her teams with both expertise and empathy. She treated everyone with respect and led with humility despite her senior position, creating an environment where collaboration thrived. In an era where many skim the surface of AI and machine learning, Jen stands out for her rare combination of deep technical knowledge and broad interdisciplinary understanding.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Any company would be fortunate to have Jen—not just for her AI/ML expertise but for her ability to bridge disciplines, provide comprehensive technical leadership, and maintain an unwavering commitment to excellence. Her journey from linguistics to computer science, and from research to industry leadership, has created a uniquely qualified technical leader who can guide teams through the complex challenges of modern AI development.",
