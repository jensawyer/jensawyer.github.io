      "I’ve had the privilege of working with Jen Sawyer twice now. Jen’s leadership skills, intelligence, and technical expertise are all top-tier. As the Director of Data Science and Engineering, Jen effectively managed her team while implementing features with complex technical challenges, such as training AI models and then incorporating them into new services. Her incredible depth of knowledge and keen problem-solving skills are matched by her natural talent for leading and mentoring others. Jen had the respect and trust of both her teams and other engineers across the company. She’s far more adept at managing and connecting with people than she gives herself credit for, and her team members appreciate her thoughtful guidance and support.\n" +
