I’m Jennifer Sawyer - an engineer and linguist who loves to travel. The full screen photos here are from some of my favorite trips because 
exploring new places and ideas has always shaped how I think and create. (Refresh for new photos)

My path from theoretical linguistics into computer science started in 2010 with a multilingual feature grammar for Germanic
languages, built on top of Regulus, a Prolog-based toolkit open-sourced from NASA that powered the first spoken dialog 
system on the International Space Station. I used it to design a prototype conversational interface for a group of search
and rescue robots in collaboration with a research group from Santa Clara University hosted at NASA Ames Research Center.
That project hooked me. I had so much fun working with these physically embodied agents that it pulled me into a PhD program
in computer science where my research focused on modeling alignment in conversational systems by building a hybrid language 
model and agent architecture similar in several ways to modern agent systems.

Life took me out of academia before I could finish the PhD, but not before I earned my master’s and spent years immersed 
in machine learning theory, NLP, logic, and language modelling. I’ve carried that fascination with me into industry, where
I still bridge theory and practice, research and engineering, people and systems.

I’ve been into language models since before they were cool. I love understanding and explaining how they work, tracing 
their evolution, family resemblances, and how they connect to the wider world of machine learning. Whether symbolic or 
statistical, old-school or bleeding-edge, I’ve always been drawn to the challenge of making machines and people understand one another.
