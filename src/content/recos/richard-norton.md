Jennifer is an excellent leader and technologist. She has helped her team to grow, providing career-building opportunities, 
even in the midst of incessant business requirements. As a senior member of leadership, Jennifer consistently builds bridges 
and keeps an eye on how to improve the organization as a whole. As a member of the Platform Team, I can personally attest 
to her efficacy as a collaborator and fellow software developer. Like all leaders I have come to respect most, Jennifer 
leads from the front, capable of throwing in with those of us in the trenches, while having the good judgment to know when 
best to delegate, in order to meet company objectives. Moreover, Jennifer is a joy to work alongside, full of camaraderie and 
good spirit. You will be hard pressed to find a better combination of technical pragmatics and skillful people leadership. 
I would welcome any opportunity to work with Jennifer again.mpany would be fortunate to have Jenâ€”not just for her AI/ML 
expertise but for her ability to bridge disciplines, provide comprehensive technical leadership, and maintain an unwavering 
commitment to excellence. Her journey from linguistics to computer science, and from research to industry leadership, has 
created a uniquely qualified technical leader who can guide teams through the complex challenges of modern AI development.
