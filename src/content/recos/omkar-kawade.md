As an engineer under her leadership, I have had the privilege of working closely with Jennifer and have witnessed firsthand the exceptional qualities that make her an outstanding manager, engineer and data scientist. Firstly, Jennifer possesses an unparalleled spectrum of programming knowledge. Her expertise spans various domains, including data science (specifically computational linguistics and NLP), backend and platform engineering, data engineering, DevOps, and more. Even when discussing all kinds of personal projects, she always has advice and shares relevant personal experience. Her academic background and practical experience in these areas contribute to her ability to navigate complex technical challenges. Jennifer's genuine passion for different programming fields sets her apart as one of the most curious and knowledgeable engineers, scientists and managers I have ever met.

Even though Jen had the time intensive role as a manager, she still managed to execute company-defining projects. Among many large-scale projects, one includes completely improving our search system from the ground up, which now provides much more relevant and accurate search results. Another example is redefining the way many services operate by bringing in bleeding-edge models, one of them being parsing NER entries from ingredient lines.

Moreover, Jennifer advocates for her team members. She not only fights for the people she cares about but also vocalizes what she believes is right and logically sound in any given situation. Her proactive approach against any inefficiencies create a work environment that values thinking outside of the box and continuous improvement.

In her role as my manager, Jennifer has played a pivotal role in my professional growth. She has actively sought out opportunities for me to tackle challenging, large-scale projects, demonstrating her unwavering commitment to the success of her team members. Her ability to provide insightful feedback, drawing from her diverse experience in various roles and situations, has been instrumental in shaping my skills and mindset as an engineer.

Jennifer truly embodies all of the values of a great engineer, scientist and manager. I would love to have the pleasure of working with her again.
