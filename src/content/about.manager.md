*I build teams where people feel safe, speak up, and do their best work — because psychological safety drives 
innovation and creativity.*

**What I bring:** Hands-on technical leadership, a commitment to psychological safety, and a people-first approach that balances
scale, innovation, and sustainability.

I build high-trust, high-output teams where people stay and thrive. At Yummly, I managed multiple teams across data and 
engineering, achieving zero regrettable attrition while still contributing code and architecture myself. I focus on 
fostering psychological safety — because when people feel threatened, they close off, hide mistakes, and collaboration 
breaks down. By encouraging open communication and addressing maladaptive patterns, I create an environment where feedback 
flows, ideas grow, and the whole team can innovate together.
