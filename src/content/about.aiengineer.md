*I make AI practical in production — from NLP models to intelligent search systems.*

**What I bring:** Deep NLP/ML/conversational agent expertise, production experience with search and recommender systems, and the ability to translate
research ideas into scalable services.

I’ve delivered multilingual entity recognition models, hybrid algorithms, and LLM-powered microservices that can be reused 
across features. I also built multilingual query preprocessing for Elasticsearch, enabling robust internationalized search 
for a platform with over 40M users. Beyond implementation, I enjoy connecting theory to practice, bringing an understanding 
of how language models from grammars to LLMs fit into real-world systems.
