*I build distributed systems and APIs that scale reliably and power real products.*

**What I bring:** Clean, reliable code; scalable backend architectures; and a practical sense for turning complexity into systems that just work.

I’ve designed event-driven backends, built services in systems serving tens of millions, and modernized legacy platforms 
to handle new global demands. I’ve architected multilingual ingestion and search services, developed APIs that streamlined 
client integrations, and optimized systems to cut costs while improving performance.
